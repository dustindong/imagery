      <div class="photo-description">Description
        <p> To me, editing a photo is just as important as the photo itself. It sets the tone and mood for your photograph. The photograph is a piece of steak and the editing is the sauce. A great piece of steak will always be delicious, but a good sauce will make the experience even better. 42nd and 1st ave is one of my favorite streets to shoot because of this view. For me it perfectly represents manhattan and the grid system. I love this area especially because it is elevated and you are overlooking 42nd street. </p>

      <div class="process-description">Process
        <p>1. Apply VSCO Film 04 Preset C Kodak Portra VC++. This applies a basic film like tone/mood that i enjoy.<br><br>
        2. In Lightroom, Under Effects, drop the Highlight Priority amount to -15. This adds a little vignette to your photo and will emphasize your subject more. <br><br>
        3. Raise the exposure to +.30 to brighten the photo a little.<br><br>
        4. Under Effects, drop the Grain to 0 amount. VSCO presets usually add some film grain like photo and i generally like to take it out.<br><br>
        5. Under Detail, Raise the sharpening level to +42. I generally like to put a touch of sharpness to my photos, but not too much.<br><br>
        6. Under basic, drop the Highlights to -48, Whites +29, Shadows +93, Blacks +2, Saturation +21, Clarity +12, Vibrance +26. At this point you can play around the basic settings, setting the mood. I felt this photo was slightly cheerful, so i raised whites, shadows, saturation, clarity and vibrance to bring out the colors and remove dark areas in the photo. I dropped the highlights to bring out the sky a little more, as I feel it was a little blown out.</p>
